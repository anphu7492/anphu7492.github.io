I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), advised by Prof. [Aniket Bera](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ab/). My research focuses on computer vision and graphics, machine translation, reinforcement learning and robotics. My recent work includes 3D reconstruction from 2D images using diffusion models and neural radiance fields, DNN based predictive models for spatial and spectral data, transformer-based multimodal machine translation and multiagent path planning.

Before pursuing the Ph.D., I gained extensive experience in the industry as a full-stack software engineer in Finland. I worked for several startups and accumulated over 5 years of experience in software development. 

Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Big data and large-scale computing with a minor in Machine learning and data mining from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), advised by Dr. [Jorma Laaksonen](https://people.aalto.fi/jorma.laaksonen). I also did my undergrad in Information Technology at [Metropolia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.metropolia.fi/en).
