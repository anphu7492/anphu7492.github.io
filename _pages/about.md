I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at `Purdue University`. I'm broadly interested in machine learning and robotics. My recent work focused on developing techniques for 3D scene reconstruction using NERF and diffusion models, machine translation, and image captioning.

Previously, I received an M.Sc. in Big data and large-scale computing and a minor in machine learning and data mining. I also earned my B.E. in Information Technology and have 5+ years of working experience as full-a stack software engineer.
